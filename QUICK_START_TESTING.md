## 🐛 If Something Doesn't Work

### Console Empty?
- Hard refresh didn't work → Try incognito
- Check browser cache → Clear all (localStorage + sessionStorage)

### Old Questions Appear?
- Using legacy path → Clear conversation
- Try longer intent (>20 chars)
- Check for workflowSpec in console state

### Cost Not Showing?
- Fill all required fields first
- Check `canComplete` is true
- Verify `costEstimate` in state

---

## 📞 Quick Commands

### Browser Console (F12)
```javascript
// Clear everything
localStorage.clear()
sessionStorage.clear()
location.reload(true)

// Check compiler active
// (Use React DevTools to inspect state)
```

### Terminal
```bash
# Server health
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/ping

# Test compiler directly
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/copilot/compile-workflow \
