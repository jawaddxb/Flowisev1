- Converts Make.com modules to ReactFlow nodes with proper positioning

**API Endpoints Used:**
- `GET /scenarios` - List scenarios
- `GET /scenarios/{scenarioId}` - Get scenario details
- Webhook execution via extracted URLs

---

### ✅ 2. Zapier Provider Adapter
**File:** `packages/server/src/services/orchestrator/providers/zapier.ts`

**Implementation:**
- Zapier API v1 integration
- Authentication via API key
- Zap listing with status tracking
- Webhook URL extraction from trigger steps
- Zap execution via webhook
- Steps to ReactFlow conversion

**Key Features:**
- Identifies webhook triggers in Zap steps
- Distinguishes between trigger and action steps
- Sequential flow visualization
- Graceful handling of limited Zapier API capabilities

**API Endpoints Used:**
- `GET /users/me` - Authentication test
- `GET /zaps` - List Zaps
- `GET /zaps/{zapId}` - Get Zap details
- Webhook execution via extracted URLs

**Limitations (Zapier API):**
- No execution polling support (Zapier doesn't expose this)
- Limited execution history access
- Webhook-based execution only

---

### ✅ 3. Provider Registry Updates
**Files:**
- `packages/server/src/services/orchestrator/providers/index.ts`
- `packages/server/src/controllers/orchestrator/connections.ts`

**Changes:**
- Registered Make and Zapier providers in provider index
- Added provider adapters to connection controller
- Updated `getProviderWorkflows` to route to correct adapters
- Updated `getWorkflowPreview` to support all providers
- Enhanced `connectProvider` and `testConnection` with Make/Zapier support

**Provider Routing:**
```typescript
switch (provider) {
    case 'n8n': return await n8nProvider.listWorkflows(connectionId)
    case 'make': return await makeProvider.listWorkflows(connectionId)
    case 'zapier': return await zapierProvider.listWorkflows(connectionId)
}
```

---

### ✅ 4. Polling Support for Async Operations
**File:** `packages/server/src/services/orchestrator/runner.ts`

**Implementation:**
- Added polling configuration to RemoteWebhook node config
- Implemented `executeViaProvider` method for provider-based execution
- Created `pollForCompletion` method with configurable intervals
- Automatic provider adapter selection based on node config
- Support for both synchronous and asynchronous workflow execution

**Configuration Options:**
- `enablePolling` - Toggle polling on/off
- `pollingInterval` - Time between polls (default: 2000ms)
- `maxPollingAttempts` - Maximum polling attempts (default: 30)

**Polling Logic:**
- Checks if provider supports `pollExecution` method
- Polls at configured intervals until completion/failure/timeout
- Returns final execution output or throws error
- Handles all status types: completed, running, failed, pending, unknown

**Provider Support:**
- ✅ n8n - Full polling support via execution API
- ⚠️ Make - Limited (no public execution API)
- ⚠️ Zapier - Not supported (no execution API)

---

### ✅ 5. Retry/Timeout Configuration
**File:** `packages/server/src/services/orchestrator/runner.ts`

**Implementation:**
- Added `executeWithRetry` generic method
- Exponential backoff strategy for retries
- Configurable retry attempts and initial delay
- Context-aware error logging
- Integrated with RemoteWebhook execution

**Configuration Options:**
- `retryAttempts` - Number of retry attempts (default: 0)
- `retryDelay` - Initial delay between retries (default: 1000ms)
- `timeout` - Request timeout (default: 30000ms)

**Retry Strategy:**
1. Initial attempt
2. On failure, wait `retryDelay` ms
3. Retry with exponential backoff (delay *= 2)
4. Repeat until max retries reached
5. Throw aggregated error with attempt count

**Example:**
```typescript
// Retry 3 times with 1s initial delay
retryAttempts: 3
retryDelay: 1000
// Delays: 1s, 2s, 4s
```

### ✅ 6. Run History UI
**File:** `packages/ui/src/views/orchestrator/RunHistory.jsx`

**Implementation:**
- Full-featured run history viewer
- Tabular display of all orchestrator runs
- Status-based color coding (completed, running, failed, pending)
- Detailed run inspection dialog
- Execution logs viewer with timestamps
- Input/output data display
- Duration calculation and formatting
- Auto-refresh capability

**Features:**
- **Run List Table:**
  - Run ID (truncated with monospace font)
  - Status chip with color coding
  - Start timestamp
  - Duration (formatted as s/m/h)
  - View details action

- **Run Details Dialog:**
  - Full run ID
  - Complete timeline (started, finished, duration)
  - Expandable inputs section (JSON formatted)
  - Expandable logs section with:
    - Timestamp for each log entry
    - Message content
    - Error highlighting
    - Nested data display
  - Proper JSON formatting with syntax highlighting

**UI/UX:**
- Material-UI components for consistency
- Responsive design
- Dark mode support
- Accordion-based sections for better organization
- Monospace fonts for technical data
- Color-coded status indicators

**Route:** `/orchestrator/runs/:id`

---

### ✅ 7. Enhanced Callback/Correlation Handling
**File:** `packages/server/src/services/orchestrator/runner.ts`

**Implementation:**
- Enhanced `resumeFromCallback` method
- Correlation ID generation and parsing utilities
- Metadata storage for callback data
- Support for WAITING status and execution resumption
- Comprehensive error handling for callback processing

**New Methods:**
- `generateCorrelationId(orchestratorId, runId, nodeId?)` - Creates unique correlation tokens
- `parseCorrelationId(correlationId)` - Extracts components from correlation token
- Enhanced `resumeFromCallback` - Handles callback data and resumes execution

**Callback Flow:**
1. External system calls back with correlation ID
2. System locates run by correlation ID
3. Callback data stored in run metadata
4. If run status is WAITING, execution resumes
5. Orchestrator continues from callback node
6. Logs track callback receipt and resumption

**Metadata Structure:**
```json
{
  "callbackData": { /* external data */ },
  "callbackReceivedAt": "2025-10-22T19:10:00Z"
}
```

**Correlation ID Format:**
```
{orchestratorId}:{runId}:{nodeId?}
```

### ✅ 8. Database Schema Updates
**Files:**
- `packages/server/src/database/entities/OrchestratorRun.ts`
- `packages/server/src/database/migrations/sqlite/1762000001000-AddOrchestratorRunFields.ts`

**New Fields:**
- `inputs` (TEXT) - Stores JSON-serialized input data for the run
- `metadata` (TEXT) - Stores JSON-serialized metadata including callback data

**Migration:**
- Created migration to add fields to existing `orchestrator_run` table
- Registered in migration index
- SQLite-compatible ALTER TABLE statements

---

### ✅ 9. Type System Enhancements
**File:** `packages/server/src/services/orchestrator/providers/base.ts`

**Updates:**
- Enhanced `WorkflowPreview.metadata` to support provider-specific fields
- Added `output` field to `ExecutionResult` (alongside `data`)
- Added `duration` and `metadata` to `ExecutionResult`
- Enhanced `ExecutionStatus` with `unknown` status type
- Added `executionId` as required field in `ExecutionStatus`
- Added `output` and `metadata` to `ExecutionStatus`

**Improved Type Safety:**
- All provider adapters now conform to enhanced interfaces
- Better support for provider-specific metadata
- Consistent data/output handling across providers

## Known Limitations

### Make.com
- ⚠️ Polling not fully supported (Make doesn't expose execution status API)
- ⚠️ Webhook URL extraction depends on scenario structure
- ⚠️ Regional differences (EU vs US) may affect webhook URLs

### Zapier
- ⚠️ No polling support (Zapier API limitation)
- ⚠️ Limited execution history access
- ⚠️ Webhook URL extraction depends on Zap structure
- ⚠️ API provides minimal execution feedback

### General
- Credential encryption not yet implemented (stored as JSON)
- No server-side feature flag gate (only UI-side)
- Preview panel in WorkflowBrowser not yet implemented
- No unit/integration tests yet

---

## Next Steps (Phase 3 Recommendations)

### High Priority
1. **Credential Encryption**
   - Implement encryption for `ProviderConnection.credentials`
   - Use existing Flowise encryption utilities
   - Add migration to re-encrypt existing credentials

2. **Error Handling Enhancements**
   - Circuit breaker pattern for failing providers
   - Better error messages for common issues
   - Retry with jitter for rate limiting

3. **UI Enhancements**
   - Preview panel in WorkflowBrowser (mini-canvas)
   - Real-time run status updates (WebSocket)
   - Run comparison view
   - Bulk run operations

### Medium Priority
4. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for provider adapters
   - Integration tests for runner
   - E2E tests for UI flows

5. **Documentation**
   - Provider-specific setup guides
   - Troubleshooting documentation
   - Video tutorials

6. **Performance**
   - Connection pooling for provider APIs
   - Caching for workflow lists
   - Pagination for run history

### Low Priority
7. **Advanced Features**
   - Scheduled orchestrator runs
   - Conditional execution paths
   - Parallel execution branches
   - Sub-orchestrators (nested workflows)

---

## Security Considerations

### Current State
- ✅ Credentials stored in database (not in code)
- ✅ Workspace isolation for connections
- ✅ API key validation before storage
- ⚠️ Credentials not encrypted (plain JSON)
- ⚠️ No rate limiting on provider API calls

### Recommendations
1. Implement credential encryption using existing Flowise crypto utilities
2. Add rate limiting middleware for provider API calls
3. Implement connection health checks
4. Add audit logging for provider connections
5. Consider credential rotation policies
